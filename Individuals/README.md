# Individuals
These are a series of individual C++ files that can encrypt and decrypt text using one specific type of cipher. Right now there is only code for a One-Time Pad cipher.

### One-Time Pad
This program takes a string of letters that it converts to a secret pad of numbers and a second string to be enciphered/deciphered. It then uses a method similar to a Caesar cipher to modularly add or subtract the pad to encipher/decipher the user's text. It must be run via a C++ compiler such as Visual Studio 2022 or [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/).
